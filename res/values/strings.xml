        Important: this plug-in can only watch for changes, it can\'t ask
        for the current state (there\'s no supported way to do that). So
        if the device is already connected at setup or at reboot, we won\'t
        know about it until you disconnect and reconnect.

        Bluetooth must be on and your device must be paired before
        configuring this plug-in.
